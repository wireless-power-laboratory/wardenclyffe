Back in the early days of electricity when the idea of coils and circuits was new, there was a scientist with a unique idea to transmit power from one place to another without using wires.

He studied very hard on the problem and learned that the earth could be used as a conductor.

After much experimentation at Colorado Springs using high voltages and distant circuits, he discovered his transmission linked through the air while its current passed through the ground.

He realized he could set the earth into vibration which allowed the delivery of power and information to anyone anywhere.

Following much fanfare and presentations to investors, he set to work at Wardenclyffe to build a generator and tower to help realize his vision.
